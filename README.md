# Cubes (Perudo) game telegram bot

Bot based on game called **Perudo**
[Wikipedia](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%9F%D0%B5%D1%80%D1%83%D0%B4%D0%BE)

Multiple players are expected to play, so you have to add this bot to any telegram group, and promote him to admin.

### Bot

Main game logic is in [game.py](./game.py)

Uses my **[tglib](https://github.com/tsepanx/tglib)** project as a submodule, to manage `python-telegram-bot` library

Docker image is available at [tsepanx/cubesbot](https://hub.docker.com/r/tsepanx/cubesbot)
